**********************************************************************
* 04-5. Understanding "useRef" and "useImperativeHandle" React Hook  *
**********************************************************************

01. The "useRef" and "useImperativeHandle" React hooks makes the value
	apply to the "ref" property in a React component.													<--- ***

	- In deed, All the components which React and React Native provides have named, "ref" property.		<--- ***

	- This clause introduces:
		① the "useRef" React hook
		② the "useImperativeHandle" React hook
		③ the "forwardRef()" function

	- All React components provides "ref" property.														<--- ***

	- This "ref" propety is *NOT* set by user code, set by React framework internals at some point.		<--- ***

	- The "ref" property is "null" at first.															<--- ***
	  Then at some point that React component is mounted,
	  the "ref" property value becomes the value of a physical DOM object. 								<--- ***

	- That is, The "ref" is the reference to the physical DOM object.									<--- ***

	- Each HTML element is the "DOM type" object in JavaScript.	(***)
	  ○ For example, All HTML element like <div>, <button> extends the "HTMLElement" super type. (***)
	  ○ The "<div>" element is the "HTMLDivElement" sub-type object of the super-type "HTMLElement".
	  ○ The "<button>" element is the "HTMLButtonElement" type object of the super-type "HTMLElement.
	  ○ The "HTMLElement" super-type provides the following methods:
		① click()  ② blur()  ③ focus()

		These methods only could be invokable when the HTML element is in the physical DOM state,
		*NOT* be invokable when the HTML element is in the virtual DOM state.							<--- ***

	- The value of "ref" property is the value at the point of physical DOM state.						<--- ***
	  ○ Thus, All methods like "click" could be invokable With "ref" property value. (That is, the physical DOM object)

	- The following is the definition of "ref" property.
	  and this shows that the "ref" property is the "Ref<T>" generic type.

	  ○ Here, Type variable(= parameter) "T" means the "DOM type" like "HTMLElement".	(***)

	  	/**
		 * @internal You shouldn't need to use this type since you never see these attributes
		 * inside your component or have to validate them.												<--- ***
		 */
		interface RefAttributes<T> extends Attributes {
			/**
			 * Allows getting a ref to the component instance.
			 * Once the component unmounts, React will set `ref.current` to `null` (or call the ref with `null` if you passed a callback ref).
			 * @see https://react.dev/learn/referencing-values-with-refs#refs-and-the-dom
			 */
			ref?: Ref<T> | undefined;				// <--- ***
		} // RefAttributes

		type Ref<T> = RefCallback<T> | RefObject<T> | null;

		// Bivariance hack for consistent unsoundness with RefObject
		type RefCallback<T> = { bivarianceHack(instance: T | null): void }["bivarianceHack"];

		interface RefObject<T> {
			  ***
			--------
			readonly current: T | null;				// <--- ***
		}

	  ○ Here, also the "Ref<T>" is the "RefObject<T>" type which have read-only property, "current".	<--- ***
	  ○ The read-only property, "current" could be "null".												<--- ***

	    That is to say, "Before" a React element "mounted",
		At the point of "Virtual DOM type", the "current" is "null".				(***)

	  ○ Because that the "current" value also be set inside the React,
	    The user code must *NOT* change the value which React sets to other value.	(***)

		So, the "current" property is the read-only.


02. Understanding the "useRef" React Hook.
	- "react" package provides the "userRef" React hook as follows:

		import { userRef } from "react"		(***)

	- The following code shows that the value gotten with "useRef" hook would be set to the "ref" property.	<--- ***
	  This is why this hook is called, "useRef".

	  * Set the "ref" property value with the "useRef" React hook :

    	const divRef: React.MutableRefObject<HTMLDivElement | null> = useRef<HTMLDivElement | null>(null)	<--- ***

		return(
			<div ref={divRef} />		<--- ***
		)									

	  ○ Then, Return type of the "useRef" React hook is "React.MutableRefObject<T>".	(***)

	  	/**
		 * "useRef" returns a "mutable" "ref" object whose ".current" property is initialized to the passed argument ("initialValue"). 
		 * The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component.		(***)
		 *
		 * Note that `useRef()` is useful for more than the `ref` attribute. 
		 * It’s handy for keeping "any mutable value" around similar to how you’d use instance fields in classes.	(***)
		 *
		 * @version 16.8.0
		 * @see https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef
		 */
		function useRef<T>(initialValue: T): MutableRefObject<T>;

	  ○ The "MutableRefObject<T>" type has the "current" property like "RefObject<T>" type 
	    which is the type of "ref" property.											(***)

		interface MutableRefObject<T> {
			current: T;						<--- ***
		}

	- Invoking the "click" method of "<input>".

	  ○ When <input type="file">, Mouse click causes to open dialog box named, "Open".

	  	<input type="file" accept="image/*" />

	  ○ If you want to display "Open" diaglog box with "programming",
	  	You should get the "physical" DOM object of the "<input>" HTML element.			(***)
		That is, the "ref" value.														(***)

		* To display file open diaglog box with programming:

			const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)

			return (       ***
				       --------------
				<input ref={inputRef} type="file" accept="image/*" />
			)

	  ○ If you want to provide "click" effect to the "<input>" element, when clicked other "button",
	    Write the code as follows:

			const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)
			
			const onClick = useCallback(() => {
					// Initial value is "null",
					// But React changes null to valid value then. (***)
					const input = inputRef.current

					if(!input) return
					input.click()
				},
				// DL : Dependency List
				// [inputRef.current]		// 1st. case : Event included in DL, No re-render.	(***)
				[]						// 2nd. case : No re-rendering requested.	(***)
			)

			// -----------------------

			return(                         ***
				<div>				   --------------
					<input type="file" ref={inputRef} accept="image/*" className="btn btn-secondary" />
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<button onClick={onClick} className="btn btn-primary">Click Me</button>
				</div>
			)

	  ○ As previously stated, the "inputRef.current" property has the "null" initial value.
		and then React changes "null" initial value to the other valid value.	(***)

	  ○ Thus, the "inputRef.current" property should be included into the "DL" of "useCallback" hook.	(***)
		By this, The "cb" of the "useCallback" hook could get valid "inputRef.current" reference, *NOT* "null".

		*NOTE: Event though the "inputRef.current" property value get by invoking "useRef" hook has changed,
			   It's designed *NOT* to re-render the component.									<--- ***

			   So, If *NO* "re-rendering" be necessary,
			   The "inputRef.current" property would *NOT* be included in DL of "useCallback".	<--- ***

	  ○ If using called, "null merging" or "Optional chaining" operator(?.)" in TypeScript,
	    The above "onClick" event handler could be more simply implemented as follows:

		* implementation with "?." operator

			const onClick = useCallback(() => inputRef.current?.click(), [])

	  ○ Then, If invoking the "click" method of "<input>" element by programming, 
	    The "<input>" element could be *NOT* displayed as follows:

		* Hiding "<input>" element

			<input ref={inputRef} className="hidden" type="file" accept="image/*" />

		  Here, For reference, the `className="hidden"` uses tailwindcss's class,
		  In CSS, "hidden" corresponds to the "display: none".	(***)


03. Example
	- Putting together what I've done so far, Make an example.

	  Please refer to the "src/pages/ClickTest.tsx" source.


04. FileList Class and Array.from() Method

	- In 02_5, The following code is the "FileInput.tsx" source:

	  ○ In the "onChange" event handler, get "e.target.files" of "FileList" type.	(***)

		Example: "FileInput.tsx" in 02_5

			export default function FileInput() {
				const onChange = (e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
					const files: FileList | null = e.target.files					<--- ***
				} // onChange

				return <input type="file" onChange={onChange} multiple accept="image/*" />
			}

	  ○ "FileList" type is a list of "File" type.		(***)
	    But "FileList" type is *NOT* JavaScript array.	(***)

	  ○ In JavaScript, The classes like "FileList" are called, "array-like object".	<--- ***

	  ○ In JavaScript, The "array-like object" could be converted into an "Array"
	    with "Array.from" method as follows:										<--- ***  

		Example: convesion array-like object into an Array.

			const files: FileList | null = e.target.files
			const fileArray: File[] = Array.from(files)


05. Read a "File" Type Object With "FileReader" Class.

	- JavaScript provides the "FileReader" class by default
	  to read a "File" type object.													<--- *** 

	  ○ The "FileReader" class provides the "readAsDataURL()" method as follows:	<--- ***

	  	Example: "readAsDataURL()" method.

			// const file: File = ...

			const fileReader = new FileReader		// ***
			fileReader.readAsDataURL(file)			// ***

	  ○ The "readAsDataURL" method in the "FileReader" class reads a "File" type object
	    and provides a image composed of string like the following:

		This method is called, "Base64 Encoding".									<--- ***

		Example: An image encoded in way of Base64 Encoding.

			[ data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AQSkZJRgABAQEASABIAA... ]					<--- ***

	  ○ Data included in the "File" type object is *binary* data.
	    Thus, When base64 encoding, It takes some time to encode.	(***)

	  ○ So, "FileReader" class provides the "onload" event property
	  	used like the following:													<--- ***

		Example: "onload" event property

			const fileReader = new FileReader()

			fileReader.onload = (e: ProgressEvent<FileReader>) => {
				if(e.target) {
					const result = e.target.result	// Result with base64 encoding
				}
			}

			fileReader.readAsDataURL(file)

		For reference, Type "ProgressEvent" is provided by default in JavaScript. (***)

	- Making a "imageFileReaderP" utility function
	  ○ Then, The code pattern of "FileReader" class like the above becomes very diffcult
	    when reading "multiple" files.														<--- ***

	  ○ To use more simply "FileReader" class, do the following:

	  	> mkdir src/utils
		> touch src/utils/index.ts
		> touch src/utils/imageFileReaderP.ts

	  ○ The suffix, "P" of "imageFileReaderP" means a function returning a "Promise<T>" object.	(***)

	  ○ The following code is to implement the usage of previous "FileReader" class
	    in the "imageFileReaderP.ts" source:

		Example: refer to the "src/utils/imageFileReaderP.ts" source

	  ○ Apply "imageFileReaderP.ts" into the "src/utils/index.ts" source

	  	Example:

			export * from "./imageFileReaderP";


06. Making a "FileDrop" Component.

	- Make a "FileDrop" component with the previous "imageFileReaderP" utility function. (***)

	- This component displays a image file to the web browser.
	
	- This component supports "Drag & Drop" of a image file into the web page or
	  select a file with "Open" dialog box.

	- The core of the component is to implement four "event handlers" used in JSX statements:

	  Example : Event Handlers.

	  	<div onClick={onDivClick} 
			 className="w-full mt-4 bg-gray-200 border border-gray-500">

			<div onDragOver={onDivDragOver} onDrop={onDivDrop}
				 className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center h-40 cursor-pointer">

				<Icon name="file_upload" className="text-xl text-blue-500" />
				<p className="text-3xl font-bold">Drop Images or Click Me</p>

			</div>

			<input ref={inputRef} onChange={onInputChange} multiple className="hidden" type="file" accept="image/*" />
		</div>

	  ○ Here, The "onDivClick" event handler invokes "click" method of "<input type='file'/>" 
	  	by programming with the previous method to implement when testing "click":				<--- ***

		Example: "onDivClick" event handler.

			const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)		// (***)
			const onDivClick = useCallback(() => inputRef.current?.click(), [inputRef.current])	<--- ***

	  ○ If user select several image files in "Open" diaglog box, 
	  	The "onInputChange" event handler invoked.												<--- ***

		Then, implement "imagesUrls" & "makeImagesUrls" utility functions in first
		to implement "onInputChange" event handler more simply as follows:

		Example: Implementation of "imagesUrls" & "makeImagesUrls" utility functions.

			const [imagesUrls, setImagesUrls] = useState<string[]>([])							<--- *** : ①

			const makeImagesUrls = useCallback((files: File[]) => {
				const promises = Array.from(files).map(imageFileReaderP)						<--- *** : ②

				Promise
					.all(promises)
					.then(urls => setImagesUrls(imagesUrls => [...urls, ...imagesUrls]))		<--- *** : ③
			}, [])
	
	  ○ In above, "Promise.all" method receives an Array composed of the "Promise" objects,
	    and invokes all "then" method on each "Promise" object in the Array.					<--- ***

		That is, "Promise.all" method plays a role in transfering an array of results
		to the "then" callback.																	<--- ***

	  ○ Now, The "onInputChange" event handler could be implemented simple like the following :

	  	Example: "onInputChange" event handler.

			const onInputChange = useCallback((e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
				const files = e.target.files					// (***)
				files && makeImagesUrls(Array.from(files))		// (***)
			}, [])

	  ○ The "imageUrls" function which made like this uses the "<Div/>" component of chap03,
	    and displays in the form of the background image of the "<div>" element:

		Example: Display an image as the "<div>" elemtnets's background.

			cosnt images = useMemo(() => 
				imageUrls.map((url, index) => (
					<Div 
						key={index}
						src={url}
						className="m-2 bg-transparent bg-center bg-no-repeat bg-certain"
						with="5rem" height="5rem" />
				)), [imageUrls])

			<div className="flex flex-wrap">{images}</div>

	  ○ In 02-5, If dropping an image file into the area, the "onDivDrop" event handler invoked
	  	and if getting the "files" object of the "FileList" type in the form of "e.dataTransfer?.files",
		Files dropped to the "imageUrls" could be appended with "makeImagesUrls" utility function.			<--- ***

		Example: "onDivDrop" event handler.

			const onDivDrop = useCallback((e: DragEvent) => {
				// ① To prevent a dropped image file to display new tab of web browser.
				e.preventDefault()

				// ② All dropped files could be taken through "e.dataTransfer?.files".
				const files = e.dataTransfer?.files

				// ③ files dropped to the "imageUrls" could be appended with "makeImagesUrls".
				files && makeImagesUrls(Array.from(files))
			}, [])

	- Example: refer to "src/pages/FileDrop.tsx" source.


07. Using the "ref" property of the "<input>" element.
	- The "<input>" element is used  in general in JSX statements as follows:

	  ○ Example: JSX code with "<input>" element

	  		<input className="input input-primary" placeholder="enter some text" />

	- If user click the "<input>" element to input value, the element is *focused*.

	  ○ Then, Without user click about the "<input>" element,
	  	It could make the element focused.	(***)

	  ○ The value of the "inputRef.current" gotten by the "ref" property of "<input>"
	  	becomes the physical DOM object.														<--- ***

		Thus, With the method of invoking "click" method of the physical DOM object

	- Example: please refer to the "src/pages/InputFocusTest.tsx" source

	  ○ Executing code, Input box is "focused" immediately as soon as web page opens.


08. Getting "value" Property's Value Of "<input>" Element Without invoking "useState" React Hook.

	- React always requests thatwrite the code in relation to the "value" property of "<input">"
	  by pattern as follows. But this code pattern is a little bit complicated.

	  ○ Example: The code pattern of "value" property of "<input>".

	  	const [value, setValue] = useState<string>('')
		const onChangeValue = (e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => setValue(notUsed => e.target.value)
		....

		return <input value={value} onChange={onChangeValue} />

	- The reasons that React requests code like this pattern is 
	  to re-render "fastlier" in "virtual" DOM environment.							<--- ***

	- If the "ref" property has a "valid" value, in other words, physical DOM object created,
	  The value of "value" property of this object could be get "directly".			<--- ***

	  ○ Here, Without the "useState" React hook, Getting the "value" property of "<input>":

	  	Please refer to the "src/pages/InputValueTest.tsx" source.


09. Understanding "forwardRef" function.

	- As its name says, the "forwardRef" function plays a role in 
	  transfering the "ref" created in the "parent" component to the "child" component.		<--- ***

	- To use the "forwardRef" function, first import it like the following:

	  ○ Example: Import "forwardRef"

		import React, {forwardRef} from "react" 

	- The principle of "forwardRef" function operation:

			[ Parent Component ] -- Transfer "ref" prop (that is, "forwardRef") to --> [ Child Component ]

			      ***																				***
			  ------------																	   -------------		
		const textInputRef = useRef()                               	const textInputView = ({textInputRef}) => {
		<TextInputView 	ref={textInputRef} />								return <TextInput  	ref={textInputRef} />
						------------------								}                     	------------------    
						       ***																	  	***

	- Understanding the Reason why "forwardRef" function required.

	  ○ In 03-5, "src/theme/daisyui/Input.tsx" source created as follows:

		import type {FC, DetailedHTMLProps, InputHTMLAttributes} from "react"

		export
		type ReactInputProps = DetailedHTMLProps<InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement>, HTMLInputElement>

		export
		type InputProps = ReactInputProps & {}

		export
		const Input: FC<InputProps> = ({className: _className, ...inputProps}) => {
			const className = ["input", "_className"].join(' ')

			return <input {...inputProps} className={className} />
		} // Input

	  ○ Then like the following, Could "inputRef" be set to the "ref" prop of "<Input />" component ?

	  		import {Input} from "../theme/daisyui"

			<Input ref={inputRef} className="input-primary" />

	  ○ That is, the "base" component "<input>" which React provides can have the "ref" prop.	<--- ***
		But "User-defined" component like "<Input />" also could be set value to the "ref" prop ?

	  	The purpose of the "ref" prop is to get the correponding physical DOM object.			<--- ***

		Because that "<Input />" which is a "User-defined" component,
		It could *NOT* get the correspoding physical DOM object.								<--- ***

	  ○ Example:  refer to the "src/pages/ForwardRefTest.tsx" source.

		Note: Instead of "<input>" base component, use the user-defined, "<Input />" component.

		- The result of execution displays as "undefined" as user input value in the display section. (***)
		- The reason is that :

		  ● "Input.tsx" source in the "src/theme/daisyui" directory is implemented as follows in previous:

		  	<input {...inputProps} className={className} />

		  ● The, the "ref" property of "<Input ref={...} .. />" must be transfered 
		    with the "forwardRef" function, *NOT* "inputProps".									<--- ***

	  ○ Type of "forwardRef" function
	  	- The following is the type definition of "forwardRef" function:

			function forwardRef<T, P = {}>(
				render: ForwardRefRenderFunction<T, P>,
			): ForwardRefExoticComponent<PropsWithoutRef<P> & RefAttributes<T>>;

		- Then, in previous, Type of properties of the "<Input/>" is "InputProps".
		  Thus, "P" type variable in "forwardRef" type is "InputProps" as follows :		(***)

		  	export 
			type ReactInputProps = DetailedHTMLProps<InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement>, HTMLInputElement>

			export 
			type InputProps = ReactInputProps & {}

		- Example: The following source is transfer "ref" property with the "forwardRef" function.

			Please refer to the "src/theme/daisyui/Input.tsx" source


10. What is the "useImperativeHandle" React Hook ?
	- The React hook that lets you customize the "handle" exposed as a "ref".		<--- ***

	- This is used in TypeScript code, *NOT* JSX.									<--- ***

	- To use "useImperativeHandle", import as the follows
		import React, {useImperativeHandle} from "react"

	- The principle of "useImperativeHandle" React hook

	  ○ The reason to be validated is why the "TextInput" core component provides "focus" method:

	  	const textInputRef = useRef<TextInput | null>(null)
		const setFocus = () => textInputRef.current?.focus()

	  ○ The birth background of this React hook :

	  	● Assumes there is the following type:

			export
			type TextInputMethods = {
				focus	: () => void;
				dismiss	: () => void;
			}

		● The core background is What if "TextInput" is replaced with "TextInputMethods"
		  as follows, instead of "TextInput" ?

		  const methodsRef = useRef<TextInputMethods | null>(null)					<--- ***

		  const setFocus = () => methodsRef.current?.focus()						<--- ***
		  const dismissKeyboard = () => methodsRef.current?.dismiss()				<--- ***

	- Type of "useImperativeHandle" React Hook :

	  ○ The definition is as follows:

	  	function useImperativeHandle<T, R extends T>(
			① ref: Ref<T> | undefined,
			② init: () => R,
			③ deps?: DependencyList
		): void;

		Here,
			① ref : To pass return value of invoking "forwardRef" function.					(***)
			② init: To pass "() => method_object" form function like "useMemo" React Hook.	(***)

	  ○ The following code shows that the usage of "useMemo" hook & "useImperativeHandle" hook are similar:

	  		const object = useMemo(() => ({}), [])
			const handle = useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({}), [])
	
		● The first parameter, "ref" of "useImperativeHandle" hook have to use 
		  the return value of "forwardRef" function.										(***)

		  This means that the "useImperativeHandle" hook unlike other hooks must be *ONLY* used
		  in the component like the previous "<Input />" component.							(***)

	- Making the "ValidateableInput" Component.

	  ○ Let "ValidateableInput" component with "useImperativeHandle" hook
	    validate whether the email adddress is writtern correctly.							(***)

	  ○ touch src/theme/daisyui/ValidateableInput.tsx

	  ○ The component assumes that it imports the following type:

		import type {ValidateableInputMethods} from "../theme"

	  ○ Next, Use "useRef" hook with "ValidateableInputMethods" type variable, *NOT* "HTMLInputElement":

	  	const methodsRef = useRef<ValidateableInputMethods>(null)

	  ○ Then, Set "methodsRef to the "ref" of the "ValidateableInput" component:

	  	<ValidateableInput type="email" ref={methodsRef} className="input input-primary" />

	  ○ This component validate email address *ONLY*
	    if "type" property of "<ValidateInput type='email'>" is "email".

	  ○ Example: refer to "src/theme/daisyui/ValidateableInput.tsx"

	- Example:

		refer to "src/pages/ValidateableInputTest.tsx"
