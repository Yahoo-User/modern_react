* How To Make Functional Component  *
*************************************

1. Here is the very simple Class Type Component:
    - Example:

        export default class App extends Component {
            render() {
                return <h1>Hello, World</h1>
            }
        } // end class

    - In deed, The meaningful section of the above is only `render` method.
      The rest code is a *boilerplate*.

    - In React Team, The `render` method section in the Class type component
      could be made of a simple function.                                       <--- ***

      This function called, "Functonal Component".                              <--- ***

2. The best advantage of the Functional Component is that
   there is no boilerplate and it makes more simple component.                  <--- ***

    - Example:

        export default function App() {
            return <h1>Hello, World</h1>
        } // App

3. There are two type of the sentence to make a function:
        ① With `function` keyword
        ② With Arrow Function

    - React Team accepts the above all 2 ways to make a React component.        <--- ***

4. 1st. method to make a Functional Component.
    - A Class Component plays a role in creating & transfering `virtual DOM`
      through `render` method.                                                  <--- ***
    - A Functional Component also plays a role in 
      creating & transfering virtual DOM.                                       <--- ***

    - The following code is to make a Functional Component by `function` keyword,
      and return <div> virtual DOM element created by JSX sentence:

      Example:

            export default function App() {
                return <div>Hello, function-keyword component !</div>
            } // App

5. 2nd. method to make a Functional Component.
    - The arrow function is an *anonymous* function.                            <--- ***
    - Caution:
      `export default` keyword could *NOT* be attached to the arrow function.   <--- ***

    - Example:

        const App = () => {
            return <h1>fuctional component</h1>
        } // App

        export default App;
